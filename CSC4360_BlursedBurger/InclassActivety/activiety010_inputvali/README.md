# activiety010_inputvali

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Project Setup:
 Create a new Flutter project using flutter create.
2. Designing the Signup Page:
 Design the user interface for the signup page using Flutter widgets.
 Include form fields for entering the user's name, email address, dob and password.
 Add a button for submitting the form.
3. Implementing the Signup Form:
 Use widgets to create the signup form.
 Define validation logic for the form fields to ensure that the user enters required
information.
 Implement validation rules for the email field to ensure it follows the correct format.
 Implement validation rules for the password field to enforce minimum length and
complexity requirements.
4. Handling Form Submission:
 Handle form submission when the user taps the submit button.
 Validate the form data before processing the signup request.
 If the form data is valid, display a success message or navigate to another screen.
 If the form data is invalid, display error messages next to the form fields to indicate
the validation errors.
5. Handling Navigation:
 Implement navigation functionality to allow users to navigate between screens.
 Use Flutter's Navigator class to push and pop screens on the navigation stack.
 Navigate to a confirmation page or home screen after successful signup.
6. Testing:
 Test the signup page thoroughly to ensure that form validation, submission, and
navigation work as expected.
 Verify that error messages are displayed for invalid input and that users can
successfully navigate to other screens.
Conclusion: By following these steps, students will have developed a functional signup page in a
Flutter application. They will have gained practical experience in implementing forms, handling user
input validation, and enabling navigation between screens, laying the foundation for building more
complex applications in Flutter.
Hint: Use flutter_form_builder for complex form functionality. Remember to add it as dependency in
yaml file.( https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder
