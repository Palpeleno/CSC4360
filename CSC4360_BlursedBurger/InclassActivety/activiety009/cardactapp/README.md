The objective of this activity is to develop a Flutter application called the Cards Activity App, where users can select a subset of cards from a fixed deck to create a hand of 3 to 6 cards. The main focus is on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations specifically for the hand of cards, allowing users to add, update, and delete cards within their hand.
